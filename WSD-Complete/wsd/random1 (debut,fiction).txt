Often regarded as one of the greatest directors of world cinema, Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray did work in motion pictures that spanned more than 40 years. Ray worked prominently in Bengali cinema and started his career as a junior visualizer. He made his directorial debut in 1955 with much acclaimed Pather Panchali. Ray's work got wide critical acclaim and his Apu Trilogy (1955–1959) appeared in Time's All-Time 100 Movies. Aside from directing, Ray composed music, wrote screenplays and also produced films. He was often credited as a fiction writer, illustrator, and calligrapher, and some of his literature work have been adapted into films by other directors.
